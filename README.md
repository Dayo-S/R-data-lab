# üìä R Data Lab: DS210 Coursework Projects

Welcome to **R Data Lab**, a curated collection of R scripts from the DS210 Systems Programming & Data Science course. This repository showcases hands-on assignments and exploratory projects using R for statistical modeling, simulation, and data visualization. Each script is designed to demonstrate core concepts in data science, with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and professional coding practices.

## üìÅ Contents

### 1. `coin_flip.R`  
**Topic:** Simulating Biased Coin Flips and Expected Value  
**Description:**  
Estimates the expected value of a two-step random process using biased coin flips. Each trial involves:
- Two flips with a 40% chance of heads
- Custom scoring logic: `+2` for the first flip if heads, `-1` for the second flip if heads  
- The `simulate(n)` function runs `n` trials and returns the average score

### 2. `gender_based_survival.R`  
**Topic:** Hypothesis Testing for Gender-Based Survival  
**Description:**  
Performs a simulation-based hypothesis test to evaluate whether the observed survival rate difference between females (66%) and males (17%) is statistically significant.  
- Simulates 100 trials under the null hypothesis (equal survival probability)  
- Calculates a p-value and determines whether to reject the null hypothesis

### 4. `categorical_project.R`  
**Topic:** Cardiovascular Data & Global GDP Analysis  
**Description:**  
Explores two datasets:
- **Heart Disease (`heart.csv`)**:  
  - Contingency table of age vs. chest pain type  
  - Pie charts for chest pain and thalassemia distributions  
- **Global GDP (`2020-2025.csv`)**:  
  - Bar charts comparing GDP of Germany, UK, USA, and France in 2020 and 2025  
  - Total GDP for the United States across all years

### 5. `numerical_project.R`  
**Topic:** Heart Health Metrics & GDP Distribution  
**Description:**  
Analyzes two datasets using summary statistics and visualizations:
- **Heart Disease (`heart.csv`)**:  
  - Summary stats for age, cholesterol, sex, and max heart rate  
  - Scatterplot of age vs. max heart rate  
  - Boxplot comparing cholesterol levels by sex  
- **Global GDP (`2020-2025.csv`)**:  
  - Histogram of country GDP distribution in 2020

## üõ† Tools & Libraries Used
- `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` for data manipulation and visualization  
- Base R functions for simulation and hypothesis testing  
- `options(scipen = 999)` to suppress scientific notation for readability

## üìå Notes
- All scripts are autograder-tested and written with reproducibility in mind  
- Code includes comments and summaries to support conceptual understanding  
- Designed for educational use and portfolio presentation
